        This was my first program using Object Oriented Program. The program
        show the use and understanding of the 4 principles of OOP, which are
        Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism. This progam
        tracks different relief items that are provided to people in need of
        help. Services provided and donated items are added to the list,
        services used are removed from the list. We also check the list for
        services, before removing it from the list.

        This program was from CS333: Computer Systems. For this project we had
        to write our own lottery system for the cpu. The lottery system tells
        the cpu which task to do first, by awarding tickets to each task. More
        tickets means higher priority, lower priority task can also give thier
        tickets to higher ones. Most of the files were included, and we just had
        to implement the lottery system, which is found in the proc.c file.
        Doing this project, made me appricate all the work that is required to
        get a pc running.
