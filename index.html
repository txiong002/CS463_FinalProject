    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="container-01">
      <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
      <p>
        I've worked in the Semiconductor Industry for over 20y years. During
        this time, I have learned to appreciate automation and how it can make
        our job easier. Which is a reason why I chose to pursue a degree in
        Computer Science. Along the way, I took an interest in Global Health and
        learned that there was demand for computer scientist in this field. I
        look forward to merging these two interest once I finish up with my
        degree.
      </p>
      <h3>Interest</h3>
      <p>
        When not busy with school and work, I love taking my camera out to take
        photos for family events, traveling, and just everyday life. Below are
        some pictures that I have taken and places I have been these last couple
        of years. (click and hold down mouse to scroll through pictures).
