# CS463_FinalProject

## Professional Profile

### Tou Xiong

This project for us to create a professional profile about us that could possibly be used for a job interview. This project was used using the skills we obtained from CS463: Intro to Wev Development. The project was deployed using Github Pages, which was a first for me, which could be found here: https://txiong002.github.io/CS463_FinalProject/.

The basic layout of the page is About Me page with a navigation bar at the top. You can click on the navigation bar links and it will take you my other pages, where you can find my resume information and a projects pages with a contact form. This project was build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Most of the major CSS styling was done with JavaScript. Which I found to be very useful when working with multiple pages.

Overall this project was quite challenging since most of it was built from scratch. With more time, I would have like to customize the page layout a little better.
